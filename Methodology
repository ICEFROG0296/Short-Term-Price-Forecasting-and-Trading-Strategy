The workflow is broken into four steps:
Step 1: Data Preparation

    Historical price data for PPH ETF is cleaned and converted into numeric form.
    Missing or invalid values are dropped.

Step 2: ARIMA Model for Forecasting

    ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average):
        AR (Autoregression): Models dependencies on lagged observations.
        I (Integration): Differencing is applied to ensure stationarity.
        MA (Moving Average): Models dependencies on lagged forecast errors.
    The auto_arima function is used to identify the optimal model parameters (p,d,q)(p,d,q) by minimizing the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

Step 3: Rolling Window Framework

    The dataset is split into training (in-sample) and testing (out-of-sample) sets.
    The ARIMA model is retrained at each time step, and forecasts are generated for the next day.
    This iterative approach simulates real-world market conditions and ensures robust evaluation.

Step 4: Trading Strategy

    A Take-Profit and Stop-Loss mechanism is implemented using the Average True Range (ATR):
        Take-Profit = 2×ATR2×ATR
        Stop-Loss = 1.5×ATR1.5×ATR
    The strategy aims for a Risk-Reward Ratio (RRR) of 0.75, balancing potential profits and losses.
