Model Performance:

    The ARIMA model parameters were optimized to (p=0,d=1,q=0)(p=0,d=1,q=0).
    The model performed well visually, with forecasts closely following actual prices.
    Residuals were symmetrically distributed with no obvious systematic errors.

Take-Profit and Stop-Loss:

    ATR-based thresholds enabled disciplined profit-taking and risk management.

Prediction Accuracy:

    The ARIMA model correctly forecasted price direction approximately 50% of the time.
    Despite the modest accuracy, the strategy leveraged the upward trend in PPH ETF prices to remain profitable over time.

Model Limitations:

    ARIMA assumes linearity and stationarity, which may not fully capture complex market behaviors.
    The strategy does not account for transaction costs or market slippage.

Proposed Improvements:

    Include macroeconomic indicators or sector-specific data as exogenous features.
    Explore advanced models such as LSTM or Transformers to capture non-linear relationships.
    Account for realistic trading conditions like transaction costs and liquidity constraints.
