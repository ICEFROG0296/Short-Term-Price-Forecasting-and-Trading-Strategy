# Short-Term-Price-Forecasting-and-Trading-Strategy
The Short-Term Price Forecasting and Trading Strategy focuses on developing an investment strategy for the VanEck Pharmaceutical ETF (PPH) using the ARIMA model for short-term price forecasting. 

Developed a machine learning-based trading strategy for the PPH ETF using ARIMA models to predict short-term price movements with ~70% accuracy, implemented a rolling window framework to train and evaluate the model on 10 years of historical data, simulating real-time performance.

Designed a risk management system with Take-Profit (2x ATR) and Stop-Loss (1.5x ATR) thresholds, achieving a cumulative return of 11% in out-of-sample performance, validating ARIMA's feasibility for short-term financial forecasting.
